# Exercise time!

Imagine youâ€™re designing Spotify. Design a page in plain HTML and CSS, that has
certain sections
- Show all songs
- Show your most played songs
- Able to add songs to your playlist

You need to design only the CSS and HTML. No need for functionalities for now.
After that, create a Repo in github and share the repo link to us!
